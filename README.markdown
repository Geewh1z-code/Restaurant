# Restaurant Management System

A Python-based application designed to streamline restaurant operations, including menu management, order processing, and data storage. This project provides a simple and efficient solution for small to medium-sized restaurants to manage their daily tasks.

## Features
- **Menu Management**: Create, update, and delete menu items with details like name, price, and description.
- **Order Processing**: Handle customer orders with real-time updates and status tracking.
- **Database Integration**: Store and retrieve restaurant data using a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for restaurant staff to interact with the system.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Geewh1z-code/Restaurant.git
   cd Restaurant/app
   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r libs.py
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The application should start, and you can access it via the provided interface (e.g., terminal, web browser, or GUI).

## Usage
